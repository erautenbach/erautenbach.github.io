# Patch a pothole!
### Authors: Byte Bellas

Potholes can be a nuisance, especially when they aren't taken care of as the weeks go by. Luckily, there is a simple solution: Patch your own pothole! We provide an easy-to-use service for both professionals and the average Joe. We can tell you exactly how many bags of tar you'll need, how to make the patch and whether or not you'll need professional help .

## Understanding Potholes
Potholes are depressions in the road surface caused by the expansion and contraction of water in cracks. They typically form during cold weather when water seeps into cracks, freezes, and expands, causing the pavement to break apart. Understanding their formation helps in choosing the right repair method.

##### Step-by-Step Guide
*Step 1: Preparation*

Safety First: Ensure the area is safe for repair. Mark the pothole with cones or warning tape if necessary.

Clean the Area: Remove loose debris, dirt, and any vegetation around the pothole. Use a broom or brush to ensure a clean surface.

Shape the Pothole: Square off the edges of the pothole to create a more stable base. Remove any loose or crumbling asphalt from the bottom.

*Step 2: Filling the Pothole*

Add a Base Layer: If the pothole is deep, add a base layer of gravel or crushed stone to provide a solid foundation. Compact the base layer with a tamp or compacting tool.

Apply the Asphalt: If using cold patch, pour it into the pothole and spread it evenly. If using hot mix asphalt, ensure it’s hot and apply it directly to the pothole.

Compact the Surface: Use a tamp or compacting tool to press the asphalt into the pothole, ensuring it’s level with the surrounding surface.

*Step 3: Finishing Touches*

Smooth the Surface: Use a trowel to smooth the surface of the patch, ensuring it blends with the existing pavement.

Allow to Set: Let the patch set according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For hot mix asphalt, it may need time to cool and harden.

##### Tips for a Durable Patch

Choose the Right Material: Cold patch is convenient but may not last as long as hot mix asphalt. For high-traffic areas, consider hot mix asphalt.

Proper Compaction: Adequate compaction is crucial for a long-lasting repair. Ensure the patch is firmly compacted.

Weather Conditions: Perform repairs in dry conditions. Avoid patching in rain or extreme temperatures for best results
